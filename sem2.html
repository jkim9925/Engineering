            1/19/24: Last week, Mr. J. Poole gave the classroom a presentation on chemical engineering. It wasn't as complicated as I had expected. This week, we started talking about this quarter's project--a mousetrap or Arduino car. My partner, Sally, and I chose the Arduino car since our friend Emma advised us that the mousetrap car is harder than it seems. I don't know why I picked the Arduino car because it seems really hard. I do NOT believe in myself, but I DO believe in Sally so let's hope she knows what she's doing...

            1/26/24: This week was quite difficult... The project we started is very hard and my partner and I have NO idea what we're doing. The Arduino car was so many components, but at the same time... so little. Am I the problem? Or is everyone having trouble? I hope everyone is so that I'm not just a silly billy. We're hoping to finish up our CAD next week, but that's being generous. Haha!
