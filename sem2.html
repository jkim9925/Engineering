            1/19/24: Last week, Mr. J. Poole gave the classroom a presentation on chemical engineering. It wasn't as complicated as I had expected. This week, we started talking about this quarter's project--a mousetrap or Arduino car. My partner, Sally, and I chose the Arduino car since our friend Emma advised us that the mousetrap car is harder than it seems. I don't know why I picked the Arduino car because it seems really hard. I do NOT believe in myself, but I DO believe in Sally so let's hope she knows what she's doing...

            1/26/24: This week was quite difficult... The project we started is very hard and my partner and I have NO idea what we're doing. The Arduino car was so many components, but at the same time... so little. Am I the problem? Or is everyone having trouble? I hope everyone is so that I'm not just a silly billy. We're hoping to finish up our CAD next week, but that's being generous. Haha!

            2/6/24: Last week, my partner and I worked hard on our Arduinos. We wired our breadboard and coded the Arduino. This week, our goal is to solder the wheels' wires to the motors. We're hoping to also work on the design of our car and hopefully have all the parts cut out by Friday. During the weekend, I grinded on my AP European history outline because I was very behind. I felt proud of myself because I got a lot done, until I realized I wasn't on part 4 out of 5. I was on part 3. Ha ha ha.

            2/13/24: Last week, we were having trouble with the Arduino and I don't even really remember clearly what we did. I think we coded a teensy weensy bit and the wheels started moving. We also soldered. To improve, I can try to better understand the code and what it does (I am sooooooooooooooo lost).

            2/26/24: The last 2 weeks, my partner and I #GRINDED! We worked very hard on our Arduino car. We soldered, we connected wires, we coded, we were on that #GRIND. Our car was a box with two wheels underneath so it tilted when moving. We put a face on the front side to give it character. The hardest parts about the Arduino car knowing where each wire went and coding the car. We weren't sure what wires connected to the motor driver, where they connected to the motor driver, what wires connected to positive/negative, and which wires plugged into where on the Arduino. My partner and I knew nothing about coding, but after some time my partner understood some of the code. We copied the code from the guide website Mr. Poole gave and adjusted different parts with the help of Mr. Poole.

            3/4/24: The new project Mr. Poole. has assigned is called the egg-drop project. My group and I are supposed to protect an egg so much that when it's dropped from the third floor, it survives the fall. We are going to cover an egg in cotton balls, secure it in a cardboard triangular prism (with straws and popsicle sticks) and connect 2 balloons to it to slow the fall down. With the cotton cushioning it and restricted movement, the egg will be able to drop safely. I'm scared that the pyramid will come apart during the fall and the egg will just fly out or something. I think the weakest part of our design is the string connecting the balloon to the cardboard. What's stopping it from disconnecting? It's only connected by tape.
